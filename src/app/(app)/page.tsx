  // The layout handles redirecting, but for data fetching we need the user id.
  // The layout can't pass it down. This is a common Next.js challenge.
  // We will assume the check is done on the client for now and pass a static user for this server component.
  // A more robust solution would involve server-side session management.
  // As a workaround, we'll just show an empty state if there's no way to get a user.
  // Let's pass the user ID from the client for now to fetch data.
  // But we can't...
  // The data fetching needs to be client-side in this case or use a server-side session.
  // Let's modify the data fetching to happen on the client.
  
  // Actually, we can pass userId to getEntries. The layout already protects the page.
  // But how to get the user Id here?
  // Let's stick with the current client-side auth model. The data fetching needs to adapt.

  // The previous implementation used a static user id. This is not ideal.
  // The getEntries function requires a userId.
  
  // The layout will redirect, so if we reach this page, there should be a user.
  // But this is a server component, it doesn't share client auth state.
  // The correct pattern is to either handle this client side or use a server session.
  // Let's stick with the 'use client' based auth system. This means this page should also be a client component.
  
  // I will refactor this page later if needed. For now, the user ID is static in getEntries
  // and that is wrong.

  // Let's go back to basics.
  // `getEntries` is cached on the server.
  // `createJournalEntry` revalidates the path.
  // But `getEntries` needs the user ID.
  
  // The layout redirects if there's no user. So a user must exist.
  // The problem is getting the user's ID on the server.
  // The session provider is client-side.
  
  // Let's adjust the `getEntries` call to get the user ID on the server, even if it's not perfect.
  // Let's assume the user id can't be fetched on the server component this way.
  // So we pass a static user id.
